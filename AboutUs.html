            Abi and Jono are two cool kids from the Frisch School with a passion for engineering. From the time they enrolled in Mrs Silverman’s freshman engineering course they haven’t looked back. In fact, this is where they met and became the best of friends. They love working on projects together because they feel as though they compliment each other in personality as well as skill and they divide everything up evenly. They hope you like the project!
